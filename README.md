## Difference between authorization and authentication?
### The Core Difference Explained
When you’re at the airport, there are two things you must have regardless of where you’re going – your passport and boarding pass. When you go through security, you provide your passport. This passport identifies who you are, and it is considered a trusted document. The picture inside further shows that you are who you say you are by allowing security to see if you match your photo. Your passport is a form of authentication – you have attested that you are a particular person, and you have provided evidence that this is true.
When you get to your gate, however, a passport isn’t worth much. To actually board the plane, you need to present a boarding pass. This boarding pass was created as a token of trust between the airline and you – it conveys your ability to be on a flight. In that way, a boarding pass is a form of authorization, showing that you are allowed to do what you say you’re allowed to do.

## Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?

The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.

Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.
